# TaskTracker

Welcome to TaskTracker, a new project management system designed to streamline workflows, enhance team collaboration, and boost productivity. Built on a robust tech stack with Go powering the backend and a Node/React/TypeScript trio on the frontend, TaskTracker delivers the most essential features for task management, progress tracking, and team communication in a small and performant package with more advanced features added all the time.

# Disclaimer

This project is part of a development sprint and is not intended for production use. It is a work in progress and may contain bugs, incomplete features, and other issues. Please use at your own risk.

This is an MVP(Minimum Viable Product) intended to be a challenge to develop a project management system in a short period of time. The goal is to achieve a basic level of functionality in less than a week. This project is not intended to be a fully-featured project management system.

It demonstrates just the core functionality of such system.

After the sprint, the project will be maintained and improved over time at dedicated repositories. With the information gathered during the sprint, the project will be restructured and improved to be a fully-featured project management system.

**TL;DR:** It's a challenge project but stay tuned for the full-featured project management system.

## Overview

TaskTracker is structured as a monorepo, containing both the backend and frontend components:

- **Backend:** Developed in Go, it handles API services, interacts with the database, and implements the core business logic.
- **Frontend:** A dynamic React application, utilizing TypeScript for type safety, Vite for an optimized build, and supplemented by tools like React Router, Axios, Jest.

## Key Features - WIP

**TODO:** Add key features here.

## Development Guidelines

### Backend Development

- Adhere to Go coding standards for structure and formatting.
- Document and test all API endpoints rigorously.

### Frontend Development

- Employ component-driven development practices.
- Ensure components and utilities are thoroughly tested.
